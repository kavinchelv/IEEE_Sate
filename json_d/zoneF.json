    "activity":"IMechE Playground - Schlieren Photography",
    "activityDescription":"This project allows the participants to have a clear view on the fluid flow/waves. As we know, there are several kinds of waves in this world of which include sound wave, light wave and heat wave and most of these waves cannot be seen clearly with the naked eye. Thus, IMechE have decided to carry out this experiment so that the participants can have chance to see the heat waves produce by the heat clearly.",

    "activityDescription":"This project shows how water level affects the flow of water. The water is slowly pouring into the special made cup and when it reaches the certain height, the water will flow all the way out through the tube. This is due to the difference in pressure acting on the fluid. During the event, participants have the chance to make one of their own with the assistance of our staff while the theory behind it will be explained by our staff. Participants are allowed to bring back their hand made cup and surprise their friends who don’t know the concept because it is just like magic.",

    "activityDescription":"This idea stems from Japanese culture - Nagashi Somen or ''flowing noodles''. The noodles will slide down a bamboo slide, where participants will have to use chopsticks to catch the noodles which will be eaten with a special sauce. So, this project takes the idea of the bamboo slide and rather than using noodles, sushi will be used instead. Participants will have a chance to make their own sushi ball and let it roll all the way down from the slide. Participants who complete the other 5 booths that are run by IMechE may claim their reward (sushi ball) from this booth.",

When it is done, the bread is toasted participants are free to use some bread spread such as jam, peanut butter, kaya, chocolate to decorate their drawings. For the vinegar drawing, participants will get vinegar dabbed cotton buds and they will use it to draw some drawings on a piece of paper. Once done, the paper is heated and their drawings will be revealed on the paper.",

    "activityDescription":"This experiment shows that not all fluids are compressible. This kind of fluid can have 2 forms and depends on the force applied on it. When a large force is been applied, the fluid will act like a brick but when a small force is applied on it, it will be very soft. During the event, participants can try to make this fluid and with its characteristics, it can act like a stress ball when it is fill into the balloon.",

The main purpose of this game is to let player to gain knowledges and interests in the study of chemical engineering and sciences. \n First, a few molecular bonding sets will be prepared. The participant is required to build a 3D molecular model by using the molecular bonding set provided. The level will vary from simple chemical compound such as H2O to slightly more complex chemical compound such as Cyclohexane. Lastly, committees are will explain to the participant about the properties and the way to build the model correctly at the end of the game.",

The main purpose of this game is to let player to gain knowledges and interests in the study of chemical engineering and sciences.\n \n 1. Players are given 5 different solutions and a measuring cylinders with 2 marking.\n 2. They need to arrange the sequences that need to pour in the cylinder themselves.\n 3. The total solutions that poured have to meet the 2-target line. One is the total volume of liquid and another is the certain liquid level. \n 4.
